# Automator for PowerToys Run

Automation Integration Plugin for PowerToys Run. Simply invoke the command `AI` followed by a PowerAutomate Workflow Name or Workflow ID. AutoIt and AHK Integration are future planned features.

## Installation

**Minimum required version of PowerToys is 0.53.1 - make sure you've got this version installed.**

Exit PowerToys, and save [rcmaehl.automate.zip](https://github.com/rcmaehl/ptrun-automate/releases/download/0.1.0/rcmaehl.automate.zip) to `%PROGRAMFILES%\PowerToys\modules\launcher\Plugins` (or wherever your PowerToys is installed), and start PowerToys.

## Usage
